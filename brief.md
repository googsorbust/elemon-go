## An Android app using computer vision teaching about the elements found on Earth in everyday objects

# Problem
People are not aware of the elements that are found on the Earth. It is also a mundane process to learn about these elements and where they occur everyday objects.

# Solution
Using computer vision to determine which elements are present in an object by scanning the object with their smart phone. This solution will also gamify the boring and mundane process that takes place when learning about the elements on the periodic table. It will be loosely based on the popular smart phone game 'Pokemon Go' where the user needs to collect all of the elements in the periodic table. They will get a different amount of points per element based on the rarity of the element.
